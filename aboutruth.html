            <h1>About Ruth Gitonga</h1>
            <p>
                I am Ruth Gitonga from Kenya, an Urban planning student transitioning to tech.<br> 
                My interest in learning how to code is driven by an eagerness to utilize technology to solve some of the pressing issues facing the world today.<br> 
                I believe that the powerful combination of tech and urban planning can be used to create innovative solutions to problems related to housing, transportation, access to resources, and other aspects of city life.<br> 
                In particular, am drawn to the challenge of creating user-friendly, visually appealing interfaces for people using digital platforms.<br> 
                Through my experiences as an urban planning student, I have developed a keen eye for detail and an appreciation for the power of design.<br> 
                <br>I am looking forward to applying my knowledge and skills to the world of frontend development.
